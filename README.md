The code is written in Python, to run the code, install packages listed in the import section and click run in your Python IDE, like Jupyter Notebook.
The neural network utilizes the Pytorch library. To minimize the training time, the code take advantage of Pytorch's graphic card capability and run the training algorithm on a Nvidia graphic card. So make sure you have NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit installed, use the Pytorch GPU version 10+ and set your device to cuda.
